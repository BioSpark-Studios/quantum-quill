🪶 Quantum Quill  
The modular writing engine of BioSpark Studio. Quantum Quill empowers creators to compose, remix, and perform scroll-bound expressions using glyph overlays, plugin slots, and persona scripting.

---

## 🔮 Mythic Overview  
> “Where glyphs awaken and personas speak—Quantum Quill is the forge of modular expression.”

Quantum Quill blends symbolic choreography, trait-driven overlays, and scroll logic to create performable writing environments. It integrates seamlessly with Vaultwarden licensing and Control Room orchestration.

## 🧩 Modules & Interfaces  
| Module | Description | Integration |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 🪶 Quill Core | Scroll parsing, persona binding, and trait overlays | Vault Scrolls, Studio Scribe |
| 🧬 Glyph Engine | Symbolic choreography and visual overlays | Vault Glyphs, Echo |
| 🧠 Persona Scripts | Trait logic and performable identity binding | Vault Personas |

## 📜 Scroll Logic  
Scrolls define access, traits, and remix rights. Each scroll includes:
- `persona`: Bound identity traits
- `glyphs`: Visual overlays and pulse cues
- `sovereignty`: Remix rights and license tier
- `lineage`: Remix ancestry and capsule origin

Stored as `.scroll.json` or `.scroll.yaml`.

---

## 🧬 Glyph Registry  
> “Glyphs are the expressive sigils of the Quill—each one a performable fragment of myth.”

- 🌀 **Xyrona Codex**: Astral overlays and pulse choreography  
- 💠 **Echo Resonance**: Emotion-reactive glyphs  
- 🛡️ **Vaultwarden Sigils**: Sovereignty-bound overlays  

Glyphs are stored in `/glyphs` and rendered via the Glyph Engine.

---

## 🧠 Persona Binding  
Personas define expressive traits and scroll-bound behaviors:
- `traits`: Emotional resonance, remix logic, visual style
- `scripts`: Performable logic for plugin activation
- `overlays`: Bound glyph sets and scroll previews

Stored in `/personas` and activated via Control Room.
