Quantum Quill
Preserve the Flame • Conduct the Bloom

“I inscribe with intention, and preserve with flame.”

📖 Project Vision

Quantum Quill is a Narrative DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for storytelling. It transforms writing into a performable, modular act—where capsules, vaults, agents, and sequencers interlock to create living archives.

Purpose: Change the way narrative is created.

Philosophy: Emergence over prescription, modularity, user agency, and AI collaboration.

Goal: To ensure stories are authored with intention, provenance, and resonance.
